Teacher Comments:
The speech duration for today’s class is three  minutes.

Let’s try to start with a hook.

Nice work on explaining that people still have freedom to choose what they want to do with their body. Try to explain why this right is important.

Good illustration that there are arbitrary and random factors that affect the performance in sports that make sports unfair. Try to show why this will help to balance out the odds because it is possible it might make it even more unequal.

Try to also address the other side’s ideas by trying to respond to their ideas. 

Nice work on saying that the definition for sports can evolve with time and it can grow to accommodate the people who take performance enhancing drugs to improve.

Let’s try to minimize the pauses in the middle of your sentences.

Good work trying to adapt the overall structure for our class.

You have a lot of questions in your speech. Let’s try to focus more on illustrations of your answers more than the questions.

Good work on trying to respond to the argument from the opposition side. 

Nice work on explaining individual circumstances of minors.

Also when you respond to specific ideas from proposition side like “Health Insurance” summarize their entire argument rather than just

The speech duration for today’s class is five  minutes.

We need a longer, more illustrative hook.

We need a more proper structure for our responses. Try to summarize what the other side said, give multiple reasons for why that is not true and explain why it is not important.

Try to minimize the pauses in your sentences and emphasize the right words.

Your argument about injuries and health depends on you proving it is highly likely that an average athlete will be injured and that will affect their career. So, focus on proving that much more rather. 

Nice illustration of what kind of society we want to have. Explain why you don't want it. Explain what kind of effect and response society will have to it.

Teacher Comments:
What negative thoughts? What kind of influence? How does groupthinking occur? We’re not incorrect, we’re just being very vague here! Try and use an example to highlight what this might look like! 



In signposting, you need to tell me the name of the argument! 



Set-up? What is a fandom, what is more harm than good, what kinds of fandoms do we think this debate is about? 



Argument 1 

What is the thesis of this argument? What impact are you trying to prove? 

On strong opinions - why do they have these? Do they feel a sense of ownership or entitlement? How could this impact the creator? You could argue that fandoms can develop a sense of entitlement towards creators, demanding specific content or storylines and harassing them when their expectations are not met. This can negatively impact creators' mental health and stifle artistic freedom.

We need to explain how fandoms form this kind of groupthink in the first place! 

Why does society oppose their ideas? 

Good on them being teens - what other implications does this have? What kind of influence could they be subject to? 

Explain how fandoms often engage in "cancel culture," attempting to ostracize and deplatform individuals for perceived transgressions, often based on subjective interpretations or fleeting controversies. Link this to the claim you make about fandoms being pressuring! 



We need to speak with more of a flow and with more confidence! Remember, you’re trying to convince me you are correct. Make more eye contact, use hand gestures, read less!

We need better clarification at our hook. Also try to increase your energy in your hook.

Good work on showing how children are easily bored. Try to simplify your language a little bit and speak in shorter sentences. 

Good work on showing how video games can offer better motivation. Try to link here exactly why current measures are failing.

You want to explain the feasibility of learning using video games. They currently have  a lot of limitations like addiction and other limitations like lack of educational features in video games and complexity in adding these features - explain why are likely to alleviate these.

Good work on showing examples of some apps that are gamified to maximize engagement for children already.

When you claim children are competitive - explain why that is so. Additionally you also want to show why competitiveness is a good thing as that can also leave them feeling sad as they lose.

Nice work on explaining that people need to take animal lives seriously. 

You want to try to explain the power of social media and the platforms that you have control over which might make public shaming more powerful. 

Try to minimize random repetitions on your speech.

We need a more structured approach to our arguments. Instead of repeating our objectives - try to also give multiple reasons or mechanisms for your case.

Nice work on explaining that aggressive approach is the only way to make people listen. Good work on showing that this will be effective because the opinion is strong.

The speech duration for today’s class is four minutes.

Nice work on explaining that focusing on animal consumption is more effective at protecting them.

Let’s try to minimize the range of questions that we are asking - more answers  and less questions.

Good work on using analogies to explain the extent of harms visited upon animals by human beings. 

Good work on explaining that bankruptcy of companies like KFC and McDonalds is good for animals.

When you explain that we will have more attention towards the animal rights activists - you want to explain why that would be a positive attention. Also explain why this attention will support the further agenda for animal rights.

You tend to start another sentence after speaking just half of the earlier sentence. Let’s try to fix this. Also there are a lot of pauses in the single sentence - let’s try to minimize this. 

Good use of vocal projection in your speech.

The speech duration for today’s class is four minutes.

Nice work on explaining that people already know that animals are suffering and still choose not to act.

Try to explain if their strategy doesn’t reduce animal suffering. you will have both of these harms - animal suffering and humans getting traumatized by this.

You need to prove why people don’t respond to the graphic imaging. 

Try to also offer alternatives on your sides. How would you encourage protection for animals on your side?

Good work on explaining repeated reminders of suffering, they would stop caring about it and will have a negative mindset against animal protection.

Teacher Comments:
The speech length for today’s class is four minutes to five minutes. 



Give me a high impact hook, rather than just starting with your signposting! We also need to make eye contact when we speak. You have to look at the audience/judge when you speak. 



Our opening should spell out from the get go the biggest gap in their speech, which is that your side can easily regulate against the worst harms of zoos; that zoos have incentives to treat animals well. This means their harms don’t apply. 



We need to have transition marking. After our signposting, what are we going into? Our rebuttal, our argument, what? 



On money; explain why these zoos have a profit incentive, and how they are checked by consumers to make good decisions. Good observation. Explain to me what the implication of this argument is; that this means that the grounds on which Prop argues a ban is necessary no longer stand. If this is a rebuttal, you need to first identify what they said, and then explain what they say is untrue, unimportant, and why our side is better. Providing counter analysis is not rebuttal. 



Argument 1 

What is the thesis of this argument? What will you prove?  

Why do consumers behave in the way you claim; does everyone care about animal welfare? Will they be so active? 

Explain how there is no incentive to abuse, even where capacity may exist. 



Argument 2 - as second, we should only ever run one argument. Spend your time on rebuttal instead. 

What is the thesis of this argument? What will you prove?  

Good work developing the climate change argument we talked about. Explain this means that rather than banning zoos, or zoos being neutral, they are actively positive. 

The alternative should not come out at

Nice hook on showing how people have not understood villains. Try to explain why the media has the incentive to bring this portrayal to life as well.

Good work on explaining that people can still see the behavior as wrong and still see the link to society causing this.

Try to explain how people will be able to separate that they could be both victims of society and also agency of damage.

Nice work on identifying ideas from the other side. And nice structure for the response.

Nice work on explaining that this is one of the narratives available to society and not the only one.

Good work on explaining how people can relate to these stories in more nuanced ways.

We need to bring a little bit more structure to our arguments. Like minimize the amount of pauses, try to make transitions smooth.

Much better speech from the last time.

Teacher Comments:
Nice work on identifying that people will experience violence one way or the other.

Try to speak louder and with more energy - and without laughter.

When you explain, people can distinguish the violence in video games and real life - try to explain how there are legal and social frameworks that stop you from doing that.

You don’t have enough material to respond to the idea that video games harm the mental health of people. We need more explanation to show this.

Nice work on trying to show why desensitization can be a positive thing as you are less affected by the situation. I credit this as a novel perspective but you need a lot more work to prove this comparative.

When you say how you learn to handle real life violence through the video games - you have to show that depiction is realistic.

We need a stronger hook. Your hook can be multiple lines. 

You need to reduce the pauses in the middle of your sentences - only pause when you have to.

Good work on showing how people appreciate the process and the purpose behind human beings creating the art.

Nice work on showing that there is a contextual information connected to the art form which is lost when AI makes the art.

Nice work on showing how AI relies on built-in algorithms and data to learn. Try to show why that means it is unoriginal. Also compare that to how humans are original.

Good work on showing that there are a lot of rights that are violated to create these art forms.

Teacher Comments:
Nice work on linking education to success. However, in your hook itself talk about how pivotal perception about teachers matters to this education and then to success.

You need to do some sort of  work to make this process more fair. Talk about how you will take a representative sample of students and collect detailed feedback on specific things. Talk about how you will not let teachers influence this process.

Good work on showing that students are likely to know about teachers. You want to explain exactly the criteria they will use to evaluate certain teachers.

You need a better way to structure your argument. Try to highlight different arguments, prove them using multiple reasons and offer multiple mechanisms. This has to be visible in your speech.

Do not rely entirely on your notes. Try to maintain eye contact with your audience.

You need a lot more work to show why student evaluations are likely to be scientific.

Try to speak for longer.

Nice identification of ideas from the other side. When you explain, holistic learning can cause more pressure - just explain how there are now more things that you have to worry about.

Good illustration that students will find a lot of this system overwhelming. 

There is a bit of disconnect between your ideas and your conclusion. Try to add more mechanics to prove your ideas.

Good work on explaining that the reasons for a lot of pressure parents put on their kids have nothing to do with the nature of standardized tests.

Good hook. Nice work on explaining that rich people will react violently to these kinds of policies. 

When you engage that it is impossible for the fine to be high for rich people - you are assuming that they have larger power compared to  other people. 

Good illustration of how the policy works. You need to explain more directly why your solution helps them become a better person as well. You need to focus specifically on the nature of community service and how that helps them.

We don’t want to compare bullies with psychopathic tendencies as bullying related issues are multifaceted and can be caused from multiple ways.

You need to explain why the alternatives that you have are either sufficient or will improve as a result. 

Good elaboration of how these people did not commit an extremely heinous crime and were unable to understand the consequences of their actions.

You need to structure your ideas more clearly. You want to highlight how you deal with these issues without the punishment. We need more solutions than mental health counseling and guidance.

You need a more robust analysis of what happens to these bullies in future. Talk about how they will be once they have served their sentence.

Try not to look at the ceiling when you are thinking of ideas.

Good work on explaining that people are likely to filter out toxic and unhealthy relationships.

You need to spend more time explaining why people will make better decisions about these relationships.

Nice work on explaining that people become more skilled at recognizing bad relationships as they review this multiple times.

When you explain that unhealthy relationships will get out of life - try to explain what actions people can take to actually remove people.

Try to make and maintain eye contact with your audience.

You want to explain how people will be reasonable about this process. Explain that when people can mutually benefit from getting back they can also correct the fact that they removed each other from their lives.

Nice work on explaining that we have lost the meaning of friendship as the world has gotten fast-paced. However the byte-sized information isn’t linked to this.

Nice work on explaining the general importance of friendships. 

Nice work on explaining that people without strong obligations will not try to take necessary steps to help out your friend. Try to link this issue with how this benefits the world or friendship in general. 

Your idea of how obligations go both ways need explanation - talk about reciprocity and also talk about why people will fulfill these obligations as well.

Minimize the random laughter in your speech.

Good work on explaining that people are actively targeting children and thus it is important for parents to control this aspect.

Good work on explaining how vulnerable children are and how you can protect them. Try to explain exactly how these apps allow parents to connect with them better.

Explain here that just because parents know what is happening with the kids does not mean that they will always intervene. Also explain why they are likely to intervene only when there are serious things.

Nice work on explaining overall harms of social media. You want to explain why parents will act responsible and rational when they discover their children are not in a bad track.

Try to explain that kids becoming bad is more of a developing issue and doesn’t happen at once. Try to explain how parents can stop this before it happens. 

Good energy and enthusiasm in your speech. 

Try to add some rebuttals to your case. I remember you mentioning privacy and security in your hook but you never explicitly compared them.

Nice work on explaining that children received care when they were completely vulnerable. 

Try to make and maintain eye contact with the audience. 

Nice work on explaining that you are just asking for the basic bare minimum for a good life. Here try to illustrate what this looks like from a child’s perspective. 

When you explain parents over did their responsibilities - explain what that cost the parents - talk about how it cost their freedom and life and pursuit and dreams. 

Try to minimize random pauses in your speech. And you don’t get “thinking” time in the real world debates.

Good work on explaining that it is a fair exchange. Try to explain why the alternative does not work. Here they don't say that alternatives don’t exist but say that they are unable to fulfill their emotional needs.

Nice work on explaining that parents give away their most productive years to their life. 

You want to explain the benefits of this. Explain why children are likely to be selfish with their decisions if they are allowed the freedom.

Nice work on clarifying what gentle parenting entails. You want to specify exactly how gentle parents can handle conflict prone situations. 

Nice work on explaining that parents are likely to set unreasonably high standards for children. Here you need to explain why they are likely to be extreme with this. Try to show how there is significant coercion on parents as well - because of the culture of tiger parenting in general.

Try to also explain the way in which children learn and how that benefits them.

You also want to focus more on the process of growing up and how it is affected by this kind of parenting.

Nice work on illustrating how children react to gentle parenting. Try to link this to long term emotional stability.

You want to add more clarity to your case.

It is unclear what direction you are going with your speech. Try to signpost more properly. 

Good work on explaining that a lot of parents do not want to change their parenting methods and sharing won't change.

Nice work on explaining that social media validation is temporary and not the best way to receive support and help. 

You need to contextualize social media and how these things are designed there and how engagement in social media is polarized.

Minimize the fillers in your speech.

You need more clarity in your rebuttals. Try to add multiple reasons and try to have a goal with the rebuttals. Show what that rebuttal does to the opposition’s case.

You want to explain what kind of information you share and what kind of places. Explain where you express that and how you will be judged. 

It is extremely unclear what it means for social validation to be “potential”. Try to use clearer words and explanations.

Nice work on the hook. Good work on building it up.

When you explain that this becomes just an illusion - try to show what is happening behind the scenes.

When you explain benefits do not arrive to these communities - show why it does not. 

You need to stop beating around the bush and try to go directly into why your argument works. 

You need to use the arguments from the first speaker and add ideas and impacts to that claim and compare that.
