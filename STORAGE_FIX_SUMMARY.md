# Storage System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Recordings Not Saving to Data Folder
**Problem**: Audio files and transcripts were not being saved to the `data/recordings/` folders even though the folders were created.

**Solution**:
- Updated `storage-service.ts` to use absolute path resolution with `path.resolve(process.cwd(), ...)` 
- Updated `transcript-storage.ts` to use absolute paths similarly
- Added console logging to confirm files are being saved
- Files now save to:
  - Audio: `data/recordings/audio/[uuid].webm`
  - Transcripts: `data/recordings/transcripts/[date]_[recordingId]_transcript.txt`
  - Formatted: `data/recordings/transcripts/[date]_[recordingId]_formatted.md`

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Redirect After Recording
**Problem**: "View All Recordings" button redirected to `/dashboard/recording` instead of `/dashboard/recordings`

**Solution**:
- Fixed redirect URL in `FeedbackRecordingWorkflow.tsx` line 301
- Changed from `/dashboard/recording` to `/dashboard/recordings`

### 3. ✅ Transcripts Not Being Saved
**Problem**: Transcripts from live recording were not being persisted to filesystem

**Solution**:
- Integrated `transcriptStorage` into `transcription-service.ts`
- Updated `storeTranscriptionResult` method to save to both database and filesystem
- Added metadata retrieval to enrich transcript files with student info
- Transcripts now save in both plain text and formatted Markdown

## How Storage Works Now

### During Recording:
1. Audio is recorded using WebRTC and chunked transcription
2. Live transcription happens via GPT-4o mini
3. When recording completes, `AudioRecorder` sends data to `/api/recording/upload`

### Storage Process:
1. **Audio File Storage**:
   - Saved to `data/recordings/audio/` with UUID filename
   - SHA-256 hash for integrity
   - Metadata stored in `audio_file_storage` table

2. **Transcript Storage**:
   - Plain text saved to `data/recordings/transcripts/[date]_[id]_transcript.txt`
   - Formatted version saved as `[date]_[id]_formatted.md` with metadata
   - Database record in `speech_transcriptions` table
   - Includes word count, confidence score, speaker segments

### Retrieval:
- **Audio**: Served via `/api/recordings/audio/[filename]`
- **Transcripts**: Retrieved via `/api/recordings/transcripts?recordingId=xxx`
- **UI**: Access through `/dashboard/recordings` page

## File Locations

```
growth-compass/
├── data/
│   └── recordings/
│       ├── audio/          # All audio recordings (.webm, .mp3, etc.)
│       │   └── .gitkeep
│       └── transcripts/    # All transcripts (.txt, .md)
│           └── .gitkeep
```

## Verification

To verify files are being saved:
1. Make a recording through the UI
2. Check console logs for:
   - `📁 Audio file saved to: [path]`
   - `📝 Transcript saved to: [path]`
   - `📄 Formatted transcript saved to: [path]`
3. Check `data/recordings/audio/` and `data/recordings/transcripts/` folders
4. Visit `/dashboard/recordings` to see all recordings with playback and transcript viewing

## Navigation Links Added
- Sidebar now includes:
  - "Record Speech" → `/dashboard/recording` (recording interface)
  - "Recordings" → `/dashboard/recordings` (library of all recordings)

The storage system is now fully functional and will preserve all recordings and transcripts for future access and analysis.
