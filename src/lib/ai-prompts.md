### Analysis Guidelines

1. **Growth Rate Calculation**:
   - Compare performance between early and recent units across all 9 skill areas
   - Track improvement patterns within each category: consistent growth, plateau periods, breakthrough moments, regression phases
   - Consider both quantity and quality of improvements with category-specific evidence
   - Factor in difficulty progression and skill transfer between speech types

2. **Required Skill Categories** (Track these 9 metrics with pattern analysis for every student):
   - **Hook Development**: Track creativity evolution, audience engagement impact, confidence growth in openings, and improvement in hook variety over time
   - **Speech Time Management**: Monitor adherence trends to specified time limits, improvement in pacing control, and adaptation to different time constraints
   - **Vocal Projection**: Assess volume consistency patterns, audibility across different room sizes, voice strength, and control under pressure
   - **Clarity & Fluency**: Track pronunciation improvement, speech rhythm development, filler word reduction patterns, and smooth delivery evolution
   - **Argument Structure & Depth**: Monitor logical complexity growth, evidence sophistication progression, reasoning depth development, and argument quality patterns
   - **Rebuttal Skills**: Assess response quality trends, real-time thinking improvement, engagement with opponents, and counterargument development
   - **Examples & Illustrations**: Track relevance improvement, variety expansion, effectiveness in supporting arguments, and cultural sensitivity growth
   - **Engagement (POIs)**: Monitor confidence patterns in Point of Information handling, leadership development, audience connection, and Q&A ability
   - **Speech Structure & Organization**: Track signposting consistency, transition smoothness, conclusion strength, and overall coherence development

3. **Pattern Analysis Triggers**:
   - Declining performance over 3+ sessions in any skill category
   - Persistent issues not improving despite targeted feedback
   - Engagement level below 3.0 with pattern of disengagement
   - Consistency score below 0.5 showing erratic performance
   - Plateau in critical skills without progression
   - Regression patterns indicating underlying issues
   - Missing fundamental skills for level with no improvement trajectory

4. **Success Indicators & Achievement Patterns**:
   - Skill mastery milestones with consistent demonstration
   - Cross-skill transfer showing integrated learning
   - Consistent high performance across multiple categories
   - Breakthrough moments with sustained improvement
   - Ready for advanced techniques with confidence indicators
   - Leadership potential emerging through engagement patterns
   - Adaptation to increasing difficulty with maintained quality

5. **Level-Specific Benchmarks with Skill Categories**:
   - **Primary Level Expectations**: 
     - Speech duration: 2-3 minutes with good time management
     - Basic structure mastery across all organizational elements
     - Growing confidence in all 9 skill areas
     - Engagement score ≥ 3.0 with positive interaction patterns
     - Foundational skills demonstrable in hook development, vocal projection, and clarity
   - **Secondary Level Expectations**:
     - Speech duration: 4-5 minutes with sophisticated time management
     - Advanced argument development with complex reasoning
     - Theory application across multiple skill categories
     - Engagement score ≥ 3.5 with leadership indicators
     - Sophisticated application across all 9 categories with consistent excellence
