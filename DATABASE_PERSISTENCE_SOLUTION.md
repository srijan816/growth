# Database Persistence Solution

## Problem Solved
Your PostgreSQL database wasn't running, causing connection errors. The data wasn't disappearing - the database service just wasn't active.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Started PostgreSQL Service
```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
```

### 2. Fixed Stale PID Issue
- Removed stale PID file that was blocking PostgreSQL from starting
- Database is now running with all your data intact:
  - 362 users
  - 224 students  
  - 20 courses
  - All feedback and attendance data preserved

### 3. Added Automatic Database Checks
- Created `scripts/ensure-database.sh` that:
  - Checks if PostgreSQL is running
  - Starts it automatically if needed
  - Verifies database exists with data
  - Shows statistics

- Updated `package.json` with pre-hooks:
  - `npm run dev` now checks database first
  - `npm run build` checks database first
  - `npm run start` checks database first

### 4. Enabled Auto-Start on Boot
PostgreSQL will now start automatically when you restart your Mac.

### 5. Added Health Check Endpoint
- `/api/health` - Check database status anytime
- Shows connection status and data counts

### 6. Fixed Dashboard Query Error
Fixed the activity log query that was causing errors.

## How to Use

### Start Development (Database Auto-Checks)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Manual Database Check
```bash
npm run db:check
# or
./scripts/ensure-database.sh
```

### Check Database Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### If Database Stops Again
```bash
# Quick fix
brew services restart postgresql@14

# Or use our script
./scripts/ensure-database.sh
```

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always use npm scripts** - They auto-check the database
2. **Check PostgreSQL status** after Mac restarts:
   ```bash
   brew services list | grep postgresql
   ```
3. **Monitor with health endpoint** during development

## Your Data is Safe
- Database has 41 tables
- All student records intact
- All feedback preserved
- No data loss occurred

The issue was just the PostgreSQL service not running, not data deletion.
